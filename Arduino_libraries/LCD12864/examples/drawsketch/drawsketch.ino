 12864 Graphics LCD library
 
 12864 is an unofficial Arduino library that supports 12864 Graphic LCDs that use the ST7920 chip.
 
 Lets try to draw a Circle, and a the number 012 on screen
  
 * EN = Arduino Pin 18
 * RS = Arduino Pin 17
 * RW = Arduino Pin 16
 * D7 = Arduino Pin 7
 * D6 = Arduino Pin 6
 * D5 = Arduino Pin 5
 * D4 = Arduino Pin 4
 * D3 = Arduino Pin 11
 * D2 = Arduino Pin 10
 * D1 = Arduino Pin 9
 * D0 = Arduino Pin 8
 * CSEL1 = Arduino Pin 14
 You also need to connect a POT with 5V on one side, ground on the other, and 5V (perhaps with 150 Ohm resistance) + LCD Pin 19 to the wiper (middle one usually). Otherwise you won't see much.
 
 This example code is in the public domain.
