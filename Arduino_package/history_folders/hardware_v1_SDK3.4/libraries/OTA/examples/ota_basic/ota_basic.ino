/*
  This sketch shows how to update Ameba image via Arduino IDE.

  (1) Download this sketch via usb at first time
  (2) Reset Ameba. It will connect to network, enable mDNS, and wait for client connected.
  (3) Modify this sketch. (Ex. the version number)
  (4) Select network port in "Tools" -> "Port" -> "Arduino at 192.168.1.238 (Ameba RTL8195A)". Then upload.
  (5) After download finish, Ameba would reboot. You can see the changes has been updated.
