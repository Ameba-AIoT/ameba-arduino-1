Example Description

This example describes how to use UART TX to simulate clock source

Required Components:
    Oscilloscope

Connect to PC
 - Connect Ground: connect to GND of oscilloscope
 - Use UART1
	GPIOA_6 as UART1_RX connect NOTHING
	GPIOA_7 as UART1_TX connect to probe of oscilloscope


This example shows: 
1. Clock signal output from UART1_TX to oscilloscope
